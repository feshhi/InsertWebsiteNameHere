                    In 2001, Elon Musk conceptualized Mars Oasis, a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse and grow plants on Mars, 
                    in an attempt to revive public interest in space exploration. Musk traveled to Moscow, Russia with Mike Griffin and tried 
                    to purchase cheap and refurbished Dnepr rockets but returned empty-handed after failing to find rockets for an affordable price.
                    On the flight home Musk realized that he could start a company to build the affordable rockets he needed instead. By applying vertical integration,
                    using cheap commercial off-the-shelf components when possible, and adopting the modular approach of modern software engineering, Musk believed 
                    SpaceX could significantly cut launch price.
                <br><br>
                    In early 2002, Musk started to look for staff for his new space company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached rocket engineer 
                    Tom Mueller (later SpaceX's CTO of propulsion) and invited him to become his business partner. Mueller agreed to work for Musk, and 
                    thus SpaceX was born. SpaceX was first headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California. Early SpaceX employees such as Tom Mueller (CTO), 
                    Gwynne Shotwell (COO) and Chris Thompson (VP of Operations) came from neighboring TRW and Boeing corporations following the cancellation of 
                    the Brilliant Pebbles program. By November 2005, the company had 160 employees. Musk personally interviewed and approved all of SpaceX's 
                    early employees. Musk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access to space, 
                    ultimately by a factor of ten.
