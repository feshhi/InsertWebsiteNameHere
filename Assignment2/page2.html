                SpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity vehicle, the Falcon 5.
                The company instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of the Falcon 9, a reusable heavier lift vehicle.
                Development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated by NASA, which committed to purchase several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. 
                This started with seed money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006.
                The overall contract award was US$278 million to provide development funding for the Dragon spacecraft, 
                Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon.[33] As part of this contract, the Falcon 9 
                launched for the first time in June 2010 with the Dragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit, using a mockup of the Dragon spacecraft.
            <br><br>
                The first operational Dragon spacecraft was launched in December 2010 aboard COTS Demo Flight 1, the Falcon 9's second flight, and safely returned to 
                Earth after two orbits, completing all its mission objectives.[34] By December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 
                and Dragon every three months.
            <br><br>
                In April 2011, as part of its second-round Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, NASA issued a US$75 million contract for SpaceX to 
                develop an integrated launch escape system for Dragon in preparation for human-rating it as a crew transport vehicle to the ISS.
                 NASA awarded SpaceX a fixed-price Space Act Agreement (SAA) to produce a detailed design of the crew transportation system in August 2012.
