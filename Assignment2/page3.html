                SpaceX is developing a fully reusable super-heavy lift launch system known as Starship. The Starship system comprises a reusable first stage, 
                called Super Heavy, and the reusable Starship second stage and space vehicle. The system is intended to supersede the company's existing 
                launch vehicle hardware by the early 2020s.
            <br><br>
                SpaceX initially envisioned a 12-meter-diameter ITS concept in 2016 which was solely aimed at Mars transit and other interplanetary uses. 
                In 2017 SpaceX articulated a smaller 9-meter-diameter vehicle to replace all of SpaceX launch service provider capabilities 
                – Earth-orbit, lunar-orbit, interplanetary missions, and potentially, even intercontinental passenger transport on Earth – but do 
                so on a fully reusable set of vehicles with a markedly lower cost structure. In 2018, the Starship system was redesigned to use 
                stainless steel instead of carbon fiber construction, to improve performance while drastically decreasing cost. Private passenger 
                Yusaku Maezawa has contracted to fly around the Moon in a Starship vehicle in 2023. The company's long-term vision is the 
                development of technology and resources suitable for human colonization of Mars.
            <br><br>
                SpaceX started manufacturing the first prototypes of Starship in 2019 at the company's facility in Boca Chica, Texas, later renamed Starbase.
                The company is developing Starship using iterative design principles, aiming to build and test several prototypes at a fast pace.
                The first successful suborbital flight and landing of a full Starship prototype was achieved in May 2021.
